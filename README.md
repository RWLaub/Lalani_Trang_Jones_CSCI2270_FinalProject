# QuizMe

## Project Summary
QuizMe is a program that allows you to quiz yourself through virtual flashcards. You can add, delete, and edit cards, while also have the obvious ability of testing yourself through the flashcards. Additional features such as a timer (to see how quickly you can answer a card) and a confidence meter (the more confident cards will appear less) may be added (depends on time). Enjoy.
